      <h2>Hunger Smash App</h2>
      <br/>
      <p>This application displays some of my favorite meals and treats.  Sometimes you just need a suggestion to stimulate those taste buds and smash that feeling of hunger.  The Hunger Smash app has you covered!  Think you have a delicious meal to add to my collection?  Just head on over to the New Meal Form and add away.  I'm always looking to try new things.  Happy hunger smash hunting! </p>
