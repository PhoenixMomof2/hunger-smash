## Frontend Setup

Use create-react-app to generate starter code for your project. Follow the instructions on the create-react-app site to get started.

## Backend Setup 
You can use this json-server template to generate your backend code. Using this template will make it easier to deploy your backend later on.

If you prefer, instead of using the template, you can create a db.json file in the root of your project with a structure that looks like this:

### `npm start`
